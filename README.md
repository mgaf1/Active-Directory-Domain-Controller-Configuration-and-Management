# Active Directory Domain Controller Configuration and Management  

This project focuses on configuring and managing an Active Directory Domain Controller (DC). Key tasks include installing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), promoting a server to a DC, configuring DNS integration, and managing Group Policies. It demonstrates the process of setting up a domain and managing its core components.  

## Preparation: Operating System, Tools, and Resources  

- **Windows Server 2019** – Hosts the Active Directory Domain Controller  
- **Windows 10 (Client Machine)** – Connects to and tests the domain environment  
- **Stable Internet Connection** – Required for updates and domain synchronization  

## Objectives  

- **Install and run virtual machines** – Set up a virtualized environment for testing  
- **Configure networking for the virtual environment** – Choose NAT, Bridged, or Host-Only networking  
- **Create a functional domain environment** – Establish a secure and manageable domain structure  
- **Set up a new Active Directory forest and add a root domain** – Create the foundational AD structure  
- **Create an Administrator account** – Manage domain users and permissions  
- **Link a virtual Windows client machine to the Active Directory domain** – Enable centralized authentication and resource access

## Steps

 - **1. Insall Active Directory** - AD - In this step select Manage tab in the upper-right conner and select **Add Roles and Features.**
